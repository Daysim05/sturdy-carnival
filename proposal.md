# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Not final but "Mars_interactive"

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A mod for the game Minecraft (java edition) that allows for the user to travel to a different plant using a portal.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I will use Java to execute my plan. Although I have never coded using Java before, using the knowledge I have gained from Python and following some guides on youtube I will make this mod. It will start off as a normal Minecraft game in a normal server, with the mod you will be able to build a portal that will essentially take you to a different dimension similar to the nether world, except it is Mars. a whole different planet. I will use video tutorials and explanations on how modding on Minecraft works to complete this project. 
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will accomplish making the portal and transporting Steve to Mars, the interface for Mars may be plain but I will make sure it gets Steve there.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I could have Mars be more dimensional. So it could be more interactive and have caves, mountains, and bad weather.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for my final project is to have Mars be its own world with beings for Steve to fight off and survival tactics for him to follow.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Next step is to do extensive research on modding in Minecraft Java edition and then search for tutorials on how to do specific things. Things like mod a new portal to a new world and coding the interface of said world to be able to execute what I want it to do. I will also do research on mars its self in order to have an idea of what the world will look like and feature (to make it as real as possible). Another thing I will research is how to make worlds more interactive for things like caves and even maybe aliens.
